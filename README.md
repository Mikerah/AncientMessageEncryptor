# AncientMessageEncryptor

## Overview
AncientMessageEncryptor is an android app that encrypts your messages using ancient crypto. It can encrypto your messages 
using a Caesar Cipher, Transposition Cipher, Vigenere Cipher and Affine Cipher. I did this project to simply review my Android
programming and to learn more about ancient crypto.

## What I've learned
Overall, I didn't learn much but I still learned things. I've gotten a better grasped of Java's math modules and learned more about ancient
ciphers. I also used new widgets in my app's ui such as radio butons and I also learned how to send implicit intents to text messaging
apps on the user's phone.

## Improvements
As always, there are a lot of improvements that can be made such as exception handling and better ui. Also, my app's ux is pretty bad. What
if the user doesn't know what a transposition cipher is? There is no explaination to the user.
